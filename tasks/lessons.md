# Lessons

Notes on decisions that took real investigation, so they aren't re-litigated.

- Chose Dekker split-based `two_product` over FMA-based (`f64::mul_add`)
  for the exact arithmetic core, specifically to avoid depending on FMA
  correct-rounding guarantees on wasm32-unknown-unknown (no native FMA).
  Rust does not contract separate `+`/`-`/`*` into fused ops, which is what
  makes the split-based approach portable. See ADR-001.
